Once upon a time there was a little boy who wanted to learn how to program. He was 27 years old and from Nepal. Now he is living in Toronto.
But then a meteor hit the city, flooded it, and dramatically changed the landscape of Toronto (i.e. the city disappeared) and the boy desperately clung to life on Rob Ford's Cadillac Escalade and lived off the remains of dying Maple Leaf dreams until the rescuers came.

THE END!!!
